# Larry-Croft-Adventures

## Description 

This was a second-year university group project for the SWEN225 (Software Design) course. In collaboration with 5 other members where we created a Java recreation of the 1989 Atari game Chips Challenge, we then added our twist to it. 

The project aimed to introduce us to modular design programming, dividing the game into 5 sections App, domain, Persistancy, Recoder, Renderer, and Testing. I was responsible for implementing the recorder function, allowing for the ability to record a game to a JSON file and then replay the game from a JSON file. 

Furthermore, this collaborative coding adventure not only challenged my technical skills but also aided in my ability to effectively work in a team environment. Working with others in the optimisation process, I gained a valuable understanding of different approaches and techniques, through  continuous incremental improvements. As a result, we were able to construct a robust game that not only ensured the safety of modular connections. This experience emphasised the importance of communication in achieving collective goals.
